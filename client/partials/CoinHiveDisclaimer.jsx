    <h5>What</h5>
    <p>
      CoinHive is a miner, a program that will use a small percent of your CPU to compute numbers that sometimes lends some Monero coins.
      Think bitcoin, but different.
      The more time you spend on the website, the more you will help it.
      It is only active when you are not actively using the page.
      If the light is green, it's currently working.
    </p>

    <h5>Why</h5>
    <p>
      Sound nuggets is a project that i personally fund.
      The hosting of the website for example, is not free.
      I want to avoid advertisements as much as openwhyd did and I wanted to try something that would not get a user to use his Credit Card directly.
    </p>

      Be assured that the miner is set as low as possible and that you won't notice a change.
